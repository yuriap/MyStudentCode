Compiler directives, are comments with a special syntax, and can be used
wherever comments are allowed.

Compiler directives
  - begin with {$ or (*$
  - are followed by the name of the directive
  - end with } or *)

Compiler directives come in three varieties:
  - Switch directives turn compiler features on or off when you specify
    + or - after the directive name.
  - Parameter directives specify parameters that affect the compilation.
  - Conditional directives control conditional compilation of parts of the
    source text.

For a summary of compiler directives versus options in the Compiler Options
dialog box, see the Directives and IDE Equivalents Help screen.
